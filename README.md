This work proposes a multi-kernel correntropy Kalman smoother for orientation estimation and considers position constraints for trajectory estimation using foot-mounted IMUs. We prove that the maximum positioning error can be reduced to 25% of the original values by involving a single loop closure, and it can be reduced to a designated value by designing multiple position constraints properly.
